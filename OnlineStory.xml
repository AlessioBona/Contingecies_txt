  TAGS description
  

  
  <par>
      paragraph tag
      takes arguments as conditional values, if all variables are true, the paragraph is evaluated
      can contain other tags, which are evaluated if the paragraph is evaluated
      
  <mod>
      modifiable tag
      takes 1 argument, name: "id" - it defines the name of the variable for the array of possible choises for that modifiable
      can only contain <pos> tags
      
      <pos> - second level tag (only in mod)
      possibility tag - can only be used inside <mod>
      takes as arguments the variables to set if the possibility is choosen
  
  <jum>
      jump tag
      takes as argument as id
      the evaluation is suspended till the next <anc> tag with the same id (which has therefore to be on the same level or on the first one)
      
  <anc>
      anchor tag
      takes an argument as id
      the evaluation continues if it has been stopped by a jump with the same tag
      
  <set />
      each argument set a variable to a certain value
  
  <and>
  <or>
      conditional tags
      their arguments are evaluated as "or" or "and"
      if the evaluation returns true, the content is parsed
  
  <if_and>
  <if_or>
      conditional tags of second order
      they take no arguments but second level tags: and, or, then, else
      <then> second level tag
      <else> second level tag
      
      
  examples:
  <if_or> <and var1="0" var2="0"> <or var1="0" var3="1"> <then>If true</then> <else>If false</else> </if or>   
  
  <set a1='-1' />
  <set a1='+3' />
  <set a2='0' />
  <set a3='4' />
  <set a4='0' />
  <set a5='0' />
  <set a6='5' />

  <if_and>
    <and a1='se_2' a2='0' a3='se_44'/>
    <or a4='2' a5='!_2' a6='be_6' />
    <then>
      <par>true*br_</par>
    </then>
    <else>
      <par>false*br_</par>
    </else>
  </if_and>
  
  
     

  SPECIAL SIGNS:
  
  *br_    becomes <br>   it's a line feed / line break
  
  up to two levels, indetation is removed
  
  
  
  VARIABLE COMPARISONS
  
  var1 = '0'      ==
  var1 = '!_0'    !=    different
  var1 = 's_0'    <     smaller
  var1 = 'b_0'    >     bigger
  var1 = 'se_0'   <=    smaller or equal
  var1 = 'be_0'   >=    bigger or equal
  
  
  
  VARIABLE SETTING
  
  var1 = '0'    =
  var1 = '+0'   +
  var1 = '-0'   -
  
  DESIDERATA:
  
  - optional possibilities = possibilities which are there only if some variable... PROBLEM: the Dictionary of choises!
      for now: implement it repeating the <mod> in two conditionals
  - condition evaluation: not, bigger, smaller, OR

  <par>Jhonny first day of work.*br_*br_</par>
  
  <par>It's 9h55 am on monday morning. Many people are already at school or at work, but Jhonny is still asleep. At 10am his alarm starts to play.
"What? Oh no!" he thinks, as he remembers that today is it's first day of work.
The radio alarm <mod id='alarm content'>
      <pos radioAlarmContent='0'>is playing music. </pos>
      <pos radioAlarmContent='1'>is playing the news. </pos>
      <pos radioAlarmContent='2'>is telling the Weather.</pos></mod></par>
  <par radioAlarmContent='0'>The Radiohead are playing "Creep". </par>
  <par radioAlarmContent='1'>Apparently there has been another leak of classified sensitive information. </par>
  <par radioAlarmContent='2'>Another day without an hurricane to put this town out of its misery. </par>
  <par>He's not used to wake up so early. "I need a shower" he thinks while he steps out of bed. </par>
  <par>He is rubbing his head and <par radioAlarmContent='0'>humming Creep</par><par radioAlarmContent='1'>mentally insulting the whole institution of Governement</par><par radioAlarmContent='2'>praying for a Tsunami</par> when he slips and falls. </par>
  
  <par>
"You see? To wake up so early is dangerous!" he confirms himself. His <mod id='hurting body part in the shower'>
    <pos bodyPartHurting='0'>head</pos>
    <pos bodyPartHurting='1'>knee</pos>
    <pos bodyPartHurting='2'>elbow</pos>
  </mod> is hurting.</par>
  
  <par>
This is no good start in the day, he mumbles. Is it a sign? Should he stay home? But he promised his mother he will give it a try. In that moment Jhonny notices that his mother <mod id='is mommy home?'>
      <pos mommyAtHome='0'>is home</pos>
      <pos mommyAtHome='1'>isn't home</pos>
    </mod>. </par>
  
  
  <par mommyAtHome='0'>A smell of pancakes comes from the kitchen. Why didn't she go to work? "Hi mom!" "Goodmorning Jay! Aren't you excited? I could barely sleep tonight! Uncle Ben called already and he is also excited."
"Ehm, sure" answers Jhonny, with the first pancake already in his mouth, "totally..." While his mother keeps talking about the meaning of this day for his life and for the family, Jhonny goes back to <par radioAlarmContent='0'>hum Creep in his Head. </par><par radioAlarmContent='1'>mentally insulting the whole institution of Governement and work. </par><par radioAlarmContent='2'>praying for a Tsunami to end all of this.</par>
</par>
  
  <par mommyAtHome='1'>Of course not, she must be at work! He is rarely up in the morning, but he knows, in theory, that other people are awake at working at this time. Poor mom.
Well, It's time to prepare some breakfast.
What do people eat for breakfast? He goes to the kitchen and starts roaming around looking for edibles. After fews seconds he finds <mod id='eaten breakfast food'>
  <pos whatEatForBreakfast='0'>some rest of Pizza from the day before</pos>
  <pos whatEatForBreakfast='1'>milk and cereal</pos>
  <pos whatEatForBreakfast='2'>some rests of sushi his sister must have left over</pos>
</mod> and eat them voraciously.
  </par>

  <par>Breakfast has been eaten, time to get ready and leave the house. He doesn't want to be late. He stands up and "ouch", his <par bodyPartHurting='0'>head</par><par bodyPartHurting='1'>knee</par><par bodyPartHurting='2'>elbow</par> is still hurting. "I should wrap it up before I go".</par>
  <par>
In the bathroom he finds some bandage a wrap it around <par bodyPartHurting='0'>his head, covering the small wound caused by the fall.</par><par bodyPartHurting='1'>his knee, to help keep it in position.</par><par bodyPartHurting='2'>his elbow, wondering if this will make any difference.</par></par>
  <par>
Back in his bedroom, he looks for something to wear.</par>

  <!-- UNCLE END -->
  <par notToday='0'>
    "Hi Jhonny!" his uncle greets him. "Are you ready for the first day of the rest of your life?"
    Jhonny shivers and nods. It isn't the first time he's entered the shop. He wonders if the lights have always been as grey as they are today.

    YOU LOSE</par>
