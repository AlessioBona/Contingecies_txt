  TAGS description
  

  
  <par>
      paragraph tag
      takes arguments as conditional values, if all variables are true, the paragraph is evaluated
      can contain other tags, which are evaluated if the paragraph is evaluated
      
  <mod>
      modifiable tag
      takes 1 argument, name: "id" - it defines the name of the variable for the array of possible choises for that modifiable
      can only contain <pos> tags
      
      <pos> - second level tag (only in mod)
      possibility tag - can only be used inside <mod>
      takes as arguments the variables to set if the possibility is choosen
  
  <jum>
      jump tag
      takes as argument as id
      the evaluation is suspended till the next <anc> tag with the same id (which has therefore to be on the same level or on the first one)
      
  <anc>
      anchor tag
      takes an argument as id
      the evaluation continues if it has been stopped by a jump with the same tag
      
  <set />
      each argument set a variable to a certain value
  
  <and>
  <or>
      conditional tags
      their arguments are evaluated as "or" or "and"
      if the evaluation returns true, the content is parsed
  
  <if_and>
  <if_or>
      conditional tags of second order
      they take no arguments but second level tags: and, or, then, else
      <then> second level tag
      <else> second level tag
      
      
  examples:
  <if_or> <and var1="0" var2="0"> <or var1="0" var3="1"> <then>If true</then> <else>If false</else> </if or>   
  
  <set a1='-1' />
  <set a1='+3' />
  <set a2='0' />
  <set a3='4' />
  <set a4='0' />
  <set a5='0' />
  <set a6='5' />

  <if_and>
    <and a1='se_2' a2='0' a3='se_44'/>
    <or a4='2' a5='!_2' a6='be_6' />
    <then>
      <par>true*br_</par>
    </then>
    <else>
      <par>false*br_</par>
    </else>
  </if_and>
  
  
     

  SPECIAL SIGNS:
  
  *br_    becomes <br>   it's a line feed / line break
  
  up to two levels, indetation is removed
  
  
  
  VARIABLE COMPARISONS
  
  var1 = '0'      ==
  var1 = '!_0'    !=    different
  var1 = 's_0'    <     smaller
  var1 = 'b_0'    >     bigger
  var1 = 'se_0'   <=    smaller or equal
  var1 = 'be_0'   >=    bigger or equal
  
  
  
  VARIABLE SETTING
  
  var1 = '0'    =
  var1 = '+0'   +
  var1 = '-0'   -
  
  DESIDERATA:
  
  - optional possibilities = possibilities which are there only if some variable... PROBLEM: the Dictionary of choises!
      for now: implement it repeating the <mod> in two conditionals
  - condition evaluation: not, bigger, smaller, OR

  <par>It's a very simple story: *br_*br_</par>
  <par>You are </par>

    <pos lose="0">losing. </pos>
    <pos lose="1">winning. </pos>
  </mod>
